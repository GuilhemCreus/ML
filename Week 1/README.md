Hello,

For this first week I tried to make efforts while coding to ensure that my code has comments and signatures.
Through the first days I have improved my presentation of the code.

I started the first week with the basics machine learning algorithms.

Apart from that, I stumbled across the fact that data standardization is important, because in the multi linear regression and in the polynomial regression I has to select very small learning rates otherwise the MSE would have jump to 10**300.

Also, very important thing, for the first week I WILL ONLY DEAL WITH TRAINING DATA.
I will not spend time on cleaning data and preventing overfitting, we will see that in the future : )
