# ML
Here is where I will upload my skills evolution in ML. I will try to keep this folder clean and readable.

The first few weeks will be devoted to learning the basics of ML in order to slowly move to Reinforcement Learning.
I will also take a quick break where I will try to learn the basics of C++ which is a very very popular programming language in the financial industry.
I will probably take some breaks to also learn methods in pricing and hedging.
